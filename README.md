EZ-Scheduler is an MCP server and custom GPT application that makes it easy to generate signup forms for any event. Organizers can quickly create events, while participants enjoy a seamless registration experience.

## High-Level Architecture

EZ-Scheduler leverages a modern, scalable architecture:

* **Server Bootstrapping**: Uses Python Fast MCP to initialize and manage the server environment.
* **Conversational Intelligence**: Leverages LangChain and Redis to handle and store multi-turn conversation context.
* **AI Processing**: Utilizes Anthropicâ€™s Claude Sonnet 3.5 to interpret natural language instructions and dynamically create event forms.
* **Persistent Storage**: Stores registration events and user data in a PostgreSQL database for reliable data management.
* **Frontend Rendering**: Employs Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS to build and style interactive, responsive registration forms.
* **Authentication**: Secured with Auth0, managing user authentication and access control.
* **Event Notifications**: Uses Mailgun to deliver reliable email confirmations and reminders to participants.
* **Client Integration**: Supports interaction through clients like ChatGPT and Claude Desktop, allowing users to generate and manage signup forms via conversational and desktop interfaces.

This architecture enables seamless, AI-driven event signups with real-time interaction and reliable data storage.
