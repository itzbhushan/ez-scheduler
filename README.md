# EZ Scheduler

An MCP server that generates signup forms for various events.
EZ-Scheduler is an MCP server and custom GPT application that makes it easy to generate signup forms for any event. Organizers can quickly create events, while participants enjoy a seamless registration experience.

## High-Level Architecture

EZ-Scheduler leverages a modern, scalable architecture:

* **Server Bootstrapping**: Uses Python Fast MCP to initialize and manage the server environment.
* **Conversational Intelligence**: Leverages LangChain and Redis to handle and store multi-turn conversation context.
* **AI Processing**: Utilizes Anthropicâ€™s Claude Sonnet 3.5 to interpret natural language instructions and dynamically create event forms.
* **Persistent Storage**: Stores registration events and user data in a PostgreSQL database for reliable data management.
* **Frontend Rendering**: Employs Alpine.js and Tailwind CSS to build and style interactive, responsive registration forms.
* **Authentication**: Secured with Auth0, managing user authentication and access control.
* **Event Notifications**: Uses Mailgun to deliver reliable email confirmations and reminders to participants.
* **Client Integration**: Supports interaction through clients like ChatGPT and Claude Desktop, allowing users to generate and manage signup forms via conversational and desktop interfaces.

This architecture enables seamless, AI-driven event signups with real-time interaction and reliable data storage.

## AI-assisted Development
* Less than 1% of the code was written by me. Almost all the code is written by Claude and Codex.
* I reviewed 100% of code. When I found an issue or an anti-pattern, I asked Claude/Codex to fix it.
    * With Claude code review github actions integrated, I had another reviewer to verify the changes.
* With TDD (Test-driven development), I was confident that any newly generated code didn't cause any regression.
    * Invested most of time in identifying test cases where the system could break and then ask Claude/Codex to address the missing feature/fix the bug
    * Leveraged the staging and localhost environment to give me confidence that any code deployed in prod without breaking anything from the past.
* Documented everything in the `docs/` directory so that I/Claude/Codex can resume development from the previous checkpoint.
  * These documents are the most interesting piece of the repo. The code and the business logic can be trivially generated if you can clearly articulate the architecture to the coding agents.

## Quick Start

### Server Setup

```bash
cd server
uv sync
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your API keys
uv run pytest tests/  # Run tests
uv run python src/ez_scheduler/main.py  # Start server
```

## Development

Each component has its own development environment and dependencies:

- Server uses `uv` for Python dependency management
- Client will use `npm`/`yarn` for Node.js dependencies

## Features

- **MCP Server**: Model Context Protocol server for Claude Desktop integration
- **Form Generation**: LLM-powered conversational form creation
- **Event Management**: Signup forms with event details and RSVP tracking
- **HTTP Transport**: RESTful API with streamable HTTP transport
