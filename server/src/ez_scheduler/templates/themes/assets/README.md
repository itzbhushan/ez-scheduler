Place themed image assets in this directory.

Expected file used by the Golu theme header:
- peacock-feather.png — a transparent PNG (preferred) sized roughly 320–480px tall.

The app serves this at:
  /static/src/ez_scheduler/templates/themes/assets/peacock-feather.png

If the file is not present, the template falls back to a built-in SVG at:
  /static/src/ez_scheduler/templates/themes/peacock-feather.svg
