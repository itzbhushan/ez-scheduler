    Publish a draft form (web-only endpoint).

    Accepts both GET and POST for one-click publish flow:
    - POST: Used by HTML form submission (primary method)
    - GET: Handles direct URL access after Auth0 callback

    Both methods are idempotent (safe to call multiple times).

    Flow (one click, no JavaScript required):
    1. User clicks "Publish" button â†’ HTML form submits POST /publish/{url_slug}
    2. If not authenticated: require_auth_session raises 307 redirect to /auth/login
    3. Auth0 login page
    4. After login: Auth0 redirects to /auth/callback
    5. Callback redirects back to /publish/{url_slug}
    6. This handler runs with authenticated user (session populated)
    7. Transfer ownership if anonymous + publish
    8. Redirect to published form (303)
